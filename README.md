ManageHeapApp
=============

The (WPF GUI based) tool purpose:
- to simulate memory usage in the application
- to analyse dump file generated by procdump (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-sg/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx)

Example of the procdump command:
procdump.exe -e -h -m 1000 -ma -t -s 1 -x dumps ManagedHeapApp.exe

-e	Write a dump when the process encounters an unhandled exception. Include the 1 to create dump on first chance exceptions.

-h	Write dump if process has a hung window (does not respond to window messages for at least 5 seconds).

-m	Memory commit threshold in MB at which to create a dump.

-ma	Write a dump file with all process memory. The default dump format only includes thread and handle information.

-t	Write a dump when the process terminates

-s	Consecutive seconds before dump is written (default is 10).

-x	Launch the specified image with optional arguments. If it is a Store Application or Package, ProcDump will start on the next activation (only).
